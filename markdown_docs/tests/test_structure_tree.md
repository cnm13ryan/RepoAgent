## FunctionDef build_path_tree(who_reference_me, reference_who, doc_item_path)
**build_path_tree**: This function constructs a hierarchical tree structure from given lists of file paths and a specific document item path. It organizes these paths into a nested dictionary format, which represents a directory-like structure, and then converts this structure into a string for easy visualization.

**parameters**:
· who_reference_me: A list of strings, where each string is a file path indicating files that reference another file or module.
· reference_who: A list of strings, similar to `who_reference_me`, but it contains paths of files referenced by other files or modules.
· doc_item_path: A string representing the path to a specific document item. This path will be highlighted in the final tree structure output.

**Code Description**: The function starts by defining an inner function `tree` that returns a `defaultdict` object capable of creating nested dictionaries automatically. This is used to build the path tree. Two lists, `who_reference_me` and `reference_who`, are iterated over to populate this tree. Each path in these lists is split into parts using the operating system's file separator (`os.sep`). These parts form the branches and leaves of the tree structure.

After processing both lists, the function handles the `doc_item_path`. It splits this path similarly but modifies the last part by prepending a star symbol ('✳️') to it. This modification is intended to visually highlight this specific document item in the final output.

The function then defines another inner function `tree_to_string` that recursively converts the nested dictionary structure into a formatted string. Each key-value pair in the tree is represented as a line of text, with indentation indicating the depth of the node in the hierarchy.

Finally, the function returns the string representation of the path tree, which includes all paths from both lists and highlights the specified `doc_item_path`.

**Note**: The use of `os.sep` ensures that the function works across different operating systems by using the appropriate file separator for each system. The highlighting feature with '✳️' is useful for quickly identifying a specific document item within the larger tree structure.

**Output Example**: Given the following inputs:
- who_reference_me = ['dir1/fileA.txt', 'dir2/subdir1/fileB.txt']
- reference_who = ['dir1/fileC.txt', 'dir2/subdir2/fileD.txt']
- doc_item_path = 'dir2/subdir1/fileB.txt'

The output might look like this:
```
    dir1
        fileA.txt
        fileC.txt
    dir2
        subdir1
            ✳️fileB.txt
        subdir2
            fileD.txt
```
### FunctionDef tree
**tree**: This function returns a nested defaultdict where each node can recursively contain further nodes of the same structure, effectively creating a tree-like data structure.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `tree` function utilizes Python's `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create a recursive data structure. A `defaultdict` is similar to a regular dictionary but automatically initializes missing keys with a default value, which in this case is another `tree`. This means that whenever you try to access or modify a key that does not exist in the dictionary, it will automatically be created and initialized as another `defaultdict` returned by calling `tree()` again. This recursive initialization allows for an infinitely nested structure, mimicking the behavior of a tree where each node can have any number of children nodes, and those children can also have their own children.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful when you need to build a hierarchical data structure dynamically without having to check if keys exist at each level. It simplifies the process of adding new branches or leaves to the tree by automatically creating intermediate levels as needed. This makes it ideal for applications such as building nested configurations, representing file system directories, or constructing any kind of hierarchical data.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
While the function itself does not produce an output in the traditional sense (it returns a callable object), here is how you might use the returned structure:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def tree():
    return defaultdict(tree)

# Create a new tree instance
my_tree = tree()

# Adding elements dynamically
my_tree['root']['child1'] = 'value1'
my_tree['root']['child2']['subchild1'] = 'value2'

# Accessing the structure
print(my_tree)  # Output will show defaultdicts with nested structures
print(my_tree['root'])  # Output: defaultdict(<function tree at ...>, {'child1': 'value1', 'child2': defaultdict(<function tree at ...>, {'subchild1': 'value2'})})
```

In this example, `my_tree` is a dynamically growing structure that can be expanded by simply assigning values to keys. The nested dictionaries are automatically created as needed, demonstrating the recursive nature of the `tree` function's return value.

### FunctionDef tree_to_string(tree, indent)
**tree_to_string**: Converts a nested dictionary structure into a formatted string representation of a tree.
parameters:
· tree: A dictionary where each key-value pair represents a node and its children (if any). The keys are strings representing node names, and values can be either dictionaries (representing child nodes) or other data types.
· indent: An integer specifying the level of indentation for nested nodes in the output string. This parameter is used internally to manage the formatting of nested structures.

Code Description: The function `tree_to_string` takes a dictionary representing a tree structure and converts it into a human-readable string format. It iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary, appending the key (node name) to the result string `s`. If the value associated with a key is another dictionary, indicating that there are child nodes, the function calls itself recursively, increasing the indentation level by one to visually represent the hierarchy of the tree. The recursion continues until all nodes and their children have been processed and added to the string in the correct format.

Note: This function is particularly useful for visualizing hierarchical data structures such as file systems or organizational charts in a simple text-based format. The `indent` parameter allows customization of how deeply nested nodes are visually represented, making it easier to understand the structure at a glance.

Output Example: Given the following dictionary representing a simple tree:
```
{
    'root': {
        'child1': {},
        'child2': {
            'subchild1': {}
        }
    }
}
```
The `tree_to_string` function would produce the following string output:
```
    child1
    child2
        subchild1
    root
```
