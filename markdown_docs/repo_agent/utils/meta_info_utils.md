### FunctionDef gci(filepath)
**gci**: This function recursively traverses a specified directory to identify and process files based on their names. It specifically looks for files ending with a predefined substring (latest_verison_substring) and handles them according to certain conditions.

parameters:
Â· filepath: A string representing the path of the directory that needs to be scanned.

Code Description: The function starts by listing all files and directories within the provided filepath using `os.listdir(filepath)`. It then iterates over each item in this list. If an item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to process the contents of that directory. If an item is a file and its name ends with the substring stored in `latest_verison_substring`, the function proceeds with specific actions.

First, it generates the original filename by replacing the `latest_verison_substring` with ".py" in the current file's name. It then checks if this original file exists and deletes it using `os.remove(origin_name)`. After that, it checks the size of the current file (which ends with `latest_verison_substring`). If the file is empty (size 0), it prints a message indicating that both the temporary file and the original file are being deleted, then removes the current file. If the file is not empty, it indicates that the latest version is being recovered by renaming the current file to the original filename.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that `latest_verison_substring` and `setting.project.target_repo` are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase before calling this function. The function uses colorama's Fore and Style for colored console output, which should be imported at the beginning of the script (e.g., from colorama import Fore, Style). Additionally, developers should handle potential exceptions such as FileNotFoundError or PermissionError to make the function more robust.
