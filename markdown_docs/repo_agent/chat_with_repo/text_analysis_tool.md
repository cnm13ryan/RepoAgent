## ClassDef TextAnalysisTool
**TextAnalysisTool**: A class designed to perform various text analysis tasks using a language model (LLM) and a database of JSON files. It supports keyword extraction, hierarchical tree generation, chat prompt formatting, querying code blocks from a database, converting lists to Markdown format, and named entity recognition for functions or classes.

**attributes**:
· llm: An instance of FunctionCallingLLM used for generating responses based on prompts.
· db_path: A string representing the path to the JSON file database used for searching code contents.

**Code Description**: The TextAnalysisTool class initializes with a language model and a database path. It provides methods to extract keywords from queries, generate hierarchical tree structures from text, format chat prompts, search for specific code blocks in the database, convert lists of items into Markdown format, and identify relevant functions or classes based on input messages.

The `keyword` method constructs a prompt to request up to three keywords related to a given query and retrieves the response using the LLM. The `tree` method creates a hierarchical tree structure from the provided text by generating an appropriate prompt for the LLM. The `format_chat_prompt` method formats a chat message with system instructions and user input ready for further processing.

The `queryblock` method searches the JSON database for code contents matching the query and returns the search results along with metadata. The `list_to_markdown` method converts a list of items into a Markdown formatted string, suitable for documentation or display purposes. Lastly, the `nerquery` method extracts the most relevant function or class name from the input message by generating a specific prompt for the LLM.

**Note**: This tool is particularly useful in environments where codebase analysis and documentation generation are required, such as automated documentation systems or intelligent code assistants.

**Output Example**: 
For the `keyword` method with query "data processing", the output could be:
```
calculateSum, processData, DataProcessor
```

For the `tree` method with a text describing a project structure, the output might look like:
```
Project Root
├── src
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils
│       └── helper_functions.py
└── tests
    └── test_main.py
```

For the `format_chat_prompt` method with message "How to use TextAnalysisTool?" and instruction "You are a helpful assistant", the output would be:
```
System: You are a helpful assistant
User: How to use TextAnalysisTool?
Assistant:
```

For the `queryblock` method searching for "calculateSum", the output could be:
```
("def calculateSum(a, b):\n    return a + b", {"file": "src/utils/helper_functions.py", "line": 10})
```

For the `list_to_markdown` method converting ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the output would be:
```
1. apple

2. banana

3. cherry
```

For the `nerquery` method with message "The function to add two numbers is calculateSum", the output could be:
```
calculateSum
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, llm, db_path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the TextAnalysisTool class, setting up necessary components for processing JSON files and interacting with a language model.

parameters:
· llm: An instance of FunctionCallingLLM, which is used for calling functions based on natural language instructions.
· db_path: A string representing the file path to the JSON database that will be processed.

Code Description: The __init__ method performs several key tasks during the initialization of a TextAnalysisTool object. It first creates an instance of JsonFileProcessor, passing the `db_path` parameter to it. This instance is stored in the `jsonsearch` attribute and is responsible for handling all JSON file operations such as reading, extracting data, and searching within the JSON structure.

Next, the method assigns the provided `llm` (FunctionCallingLLM) instance to the `llm` attribute of the TextAnalysisTool object. This allows the tool to leverage the language model's capabilities throughout its lifecycle for tasks like function invocation based on natural language inputs.

Finally, it stores the `db_path` parameter in the `db_path` attribute, which can be used later if there is a need to reference or modify the path to the JSON database file directly from an instance of TextAnalysisTool.

Note: The initialization process sets up the necessary infrastructure for text analysis tasks by integrating both the language model and the JSON data processing capabilities. Developers should ensure that the `llm` parameter is correctly configured and that the `db_path` points to a valid JSON file for optimal functionality.

### FunctionDef keyword(self, query)
**keyword**: This function generates a list of up to three relevant code keywords based on a given query.
parameters:
· query: A string representing the user's input or question for which keywords need to be extracted.

Code Description: The `keyword` function constructs a prompt that requests the generation of code-related keywords from an input query. It limits the output to no more than three keywords. This prompt is then sent to a language model (llm) through its `complete` method, which processes the prompt and returns a response containing the keywords. The function finally returns this response.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where keyword extraction from user queries is necessary for tasks such as information retrieval, code documentation generation, or search optimization within software repositories.

Output Example: For an input query "How to implement a binary search algorithm in Python?", the function might return "binary search, Python implementation, algorithm".
***
### FunctionDef tree(self, query)
**tree**: This function takes a text input and generates a tree structure representing its hierarchy by utilizing an underlying language model (LLM).
parameters:
· query: A string containing the text to be analyzed and structured into a hierarchical tree format.
Code Description: The function constructs a prompt that includes the provided text under analysis. It then sends this prompt to a language model (referred to as `self.llm`) for processing. The LLM is expected to interpret the hierarchy within the text and return a response formatted as a tree structure. This response, which represents the hierarchical breakdown of the input text, is subsequently returned by the function.
Note: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to visualize or understand the organizational structure of a given piece of text, such as in document analysis, outlining content for writing projects, or breaking down complex information into more digestible parts.
Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

For an input query like "The company has three departments: Sales, Marketing, and Engineering. Sales is further divided into North, South, and East regions.", the function might return:

```
Company
├── Departments
│   ├── Sales
│   │   ├── North Region
│   │   ├── South Region
│   │   └── East Region
│   ├── Marketing
│   └── Engineering
```

### FunctionDef format_chat_prompt(self, message, instruction)
**format_chat_prompt**: This function constructs a formatted chat prompt by combining an instruction and a user message into a structured string format suitable for further processing, such as input to a language model.

parameters:
· message: A string representing the user's query or message.
· instruction: A string providing guidance or context on how the assistant should respond to the user's message.

Code Description: The function takes two strings as inputs - 'message' and 'instruction'. It then creates a formatted prompt by prefixing the 'instruction' with "System:", the 'message' with "User:", and appending "Assistant:" at the end. This format is commonly used in chatbot systems to clearly delineate between system instructions, user input, and assistant responses.

Note: The formatted prompt returned by this function is intended for use as an input in subsequent steps of a conversation processing pipeline, such as generating a response or querying a knowledge base.

Output Example: If the inputs are "message" = "What is the capital of France?" and "instruction" = "Provide accurate information", the output will be:
System:Provide accurate information
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant:
***
### FunctionDef queryblock(self, message)
**queryblock**: This function queries a JSON database to find items containing specific names matching the given message. It retrieves both the associated 'code_content' and 'md_content' of these items.

parameters:
· message: A string representing the name or keyword being searched for within the data structure stored in the JSON file.

Code Description: The `queryblock` function is designed to facilitate searching through a structured JSON database. It leverages another method, `search_code_contents_by_name`, from the `JsonFileProcessor` class. This method searches the JSON file specified by `self.db_path` for items where the 'name' key matches the provided `message`. The search process involves loading the JSON data and recursively traversing it to find all matching entries.

Upon finding matches, the function collects both the 'code_content' and 'md_content' of these items into two separate lists. These lists are then returned as a tuple. If no matches are found, the function returns a default message indicating that no matching item was found in both lists.

The `queryblock` function is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific code snippets or markdown documentation based on names or keywords stored within a JSON database.

Note: This function assumes that the JSON file adheres to a specific structure, containing 'name', 'code_content', and 'md_content' keys. Developers should ensure their data aligns with this expected format for optimal functionality.

Output Example:
If the search message matches items in the JSON file, the function might return something like this:

[["def example_function():\n    print('Hello, world!')"], ["This is an example of a simple Python function."]]

If no matching item is found, it returns:

["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."]
***
### FunctionDef list_to_markdown(self, search_result)
**list_to_markdown**: Converts a list of strings into a Markdown formatted string where each element of the list is numbered.

parameters:
· search_result: A list of strings that need to be converted into a numbered Markdown format.

Code Description: The function iterates over each element in the provided list, `search_result`. For each element, it appends a line to the `markdown_str` variable formatted as a numbered item in Markdown. The numbering starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each subsequent element in the list. Each item is followed by two newline characters (`\n\n`) to ensure proper spacing between items in the final Markdown output.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to present a list of items in a user-friendly, readable format within a document or interface that supports Markdown rendering. It can be used in various contexts where lists are presented, such as displaying search results, instructions, or any other sequential data.

Output Example: If the input `search_result` is `["First item", "Second item", "Third item"]`, the function will return the string:
1. First item

2. Second item

3. Third item
***
### FunctionDef nerquery(self, message)
**nerquery**: This function processes a given input message to extract the most relevant class or function name based on predefined instructions.

parameters:
· message: A string containing the user's query or input text from which the function aims to identify and return a specific class or function name.

Code Description: The `nerquery` method constructs an instruction that guides the extraction of a pure class or function name from the provided message. It ensures that the output is strictly a single, unadorned name without any additional characters or formatting. This instruction is then combined with the user's input to form a query. The query is passed to a language model (LLM) for processing and completion. The response generated by the LLM, which should be the extracted class or function name, is returned as the output of this method.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to identify specific classes or functions from unstructured text data, such as documentation, comments, or user queries. This function helps in automating the extraction process, ensuring consistency and accuracy in identifying relevant code elements.

Output Example: Given an input message like "The function responsible for calculating the sum of two numbers is defined in the math_operations module", the `nerquery` method might return "calculateSum" if that is the pure function name identified by the language model.
