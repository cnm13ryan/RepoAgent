## ClassDef VectorStoreManager
**VectorStoreManager**: Manages vector stores for efficient querying of documents based on semantic similarity.

attributes:
· top_k: Specifies the number of top similar results to return when querying.
· llm: Language model used for generating responses and embeddings.

Code Description: The VectorStoreManager class is designed to handle the creation and querying of a vector store. It initializes with parameters for the number of top-k results and a language model (llm). The primary methods are `create_vector_store` and `query_store`.

The `create_vector_store` method processes markdown content and metadata, ensuring they match in length. It uses ChromaDB as the underlying storage system and OpenAI's embedding model to convert text into vector representations. The method employs a semantic chunker (SimpleNodeParser) for splitting documents into meaningful chunks. If semantic chunking fails, it falls back to sentence-based splitting.

The processed nodes are then indexed in a ChromaVectorStore, which is part of the storage context used by the VectorStoreIndex. This index facilitates efficient querying based on similarity. A retriever and response synthesizer are set up using this index, and the query engine is initialized for future queries.

The `query_store` method allows querying the vector store with a given string. It checks if the query engine has been initialized; otherwise, it logs an error. If initialized, it retrieves relevant documents based on similarity to the query and returns them along with their metadata.

Note: Usage points include creating a vector store by providing markdown contents and metadata, and querying this store for relevant information using natural language queries.

Output Example: Mock up of a possible appearance of the code's return value from `query_store` method.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, top_k, llm)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the VectorStoreManager class.
parameters:
· top_k: Specifies the number of top similar results to return from vector similarity searches.
· llm: Represents a language model that will be used for processing queries or generating responses.

Code Description: The __init__ method sets up the initial state of the VectorStoreManager object. It initializes several attributes:
- query_engine is set to None, indicating that no specific query engine has been assigned yet. This attribute can be updated later with a concrete implementation.
- chroma_db_path defines the default path where the Chroma database will be stored or accessed. The current setting points to "./chroma_db".
- collection_name sets the name of the default collection within the Chroma database, which is "test" in this case.
- similarity_top_k is assigned the value of top_k, which determines how many of the most similar results should be retrieved during a search operation.
- llm stores the language model passed as an argument. This model can be utilized for various tasks such as query processing or generating responses based on the data stored in the vector database.

Note: Usage points include setting up the VectorStoreManager with a specified number of top-k results and integrating a language model for enhanced functionality. Developers should ensure that the chroma_db_path points to a valid location where the Chroma database can be accessed, and they may customize the collection_name as needed for their specific use case.

### FunctionDef create_vector_store(self, md_contents, meta_data, api_key, api_base)
**create_vector_store**: This function adds markdown content and metadata to a vector index using ChromaDB as the storage backend and OpenAI embeddings for semantic similarity.

parameters:
· md_contents: A list of strings, where each string is a markdown document to be added to the vector store.
· meta_data: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains metadata corresponding to the markdown documents in `md_contents`.
· api_key: A string representing the API key for accessing OpenAI's embedding service.
· api_base: A string representing the base URL for OpenAI's API.

Code Description: The function first checks if either `md_contents` or `meta_data` is empty and logs a warning message before returning if true. It then ensures that both lists have the same length by truncating them to the minimum length of the two. This step prevents mismatches between markdown content and metadata entries.

Next, it initializes a ChromaDB client connected to a specified path and retrieves or creates a collection with a predefined name. An embedding model using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` is instantiated with the provided API key and base URL.

The function then sets up two text splitters: a semantic splitter (`SemanticSplitterNodeParser`) for dividing documents into meaningful chunks based on their content, and a sentence splitter (`SentenceSplitter`) as a fallback option. It creates `Document` objects from the markdown contents and metadata, which are subsequently processed by these splitters.

For each document, the function attempts to split it using the semantic splitter. If this process fails due to an exception (e.g., if the document is too short or contains no meaningful segments), it falls back to the sentence splitter. The resulting chunks are collected into a list of nodes.

If no valid nodes are generated after processing all documents, the function logs a warning and returns without further action. Otherwise, it initializes a `ChromaVectorStore` with the ChromaDB collection, sets up a storage context, and creates an index from the nodes using this vector store and embedding model.

A retriever is configured to fetch the top-k similar entries based on the similarity score, and a response synthesizer is set up for generating responses. These components are combined into a query engine, which is stored in the `query_engine` attribute of the class instance.

Finally, the function logs an informational message indicating that the vector store has been successfully created and loaded with the specified number of documents.

Note: This function modifies the state of the object by setting up a query engine. It does not return any value explicitly but prepares the system for querying the stored data.

Output Example: No explicit return value is provided, but upon successful execution, the vector store will be populated with the processed markdown contents and metadata, and the `query_engine` attribute will be set up for querying this data. The logs will indicate the number of documents processed and any warnings or errors encountered during the process.

### FunctionDef query_store(self, query)
**query_store**: Brief function description.
This function queries a vector store to find relevant documents based on the input query.

parameters:
· query: A string representing the search term or question used to retrieve relevant documents from the vector store.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `query_store` method is designed to interact with a vector store, which is typically an index of preprocessed documents optimized for fast similarity searches. The function first checks if the `query_engine`, which is responsible for executing queries against the vector store, has been initialized. If not, it logs an error message and returns an empty list.

If the query engine is available, the method proceeds to log a debug statement indicating that a query is being made with the provided query string. It then calls the `query` method of the `query_engine`, passing in the query string. The results from this call are expected to contain relevant documents and associated metadata.

The function processes these results by extracting the response text and metadata, returning them as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains two keys: "text", which holds the content of the document, and "metadata", which includes additional information about the document such as its source or type.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used in scenarios where there is a need to retrieve documents relevant to a user's query from a large corpus. It is part of a larger system that might involve natural language processing tasks like keyword extraction, reranking results based on relevance, and generating final responses using techniques such as Retrieve and Generate (RAG).

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

        "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
        "metadata": {"source": "example.txt", "type": "document"}

    {
        "text": "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
        "metadata": {"source": "wisdom_book.pdf", "type": "quote"}
    }
